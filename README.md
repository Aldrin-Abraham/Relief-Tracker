# ReliefTracker â€“ Disaster Relief Management System ðŸŽ¯
ReliefTracker is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing disaster relief requests and resources efficiently. It allows users to submit relief requests, track assistance, and enables organizations to manage aid distribution effectively.

## Project Overview
ReliefTracker is a web-based disaster relief management system designed to facilitate the distribution of aid to affected individuals and communities. The system allows users to submit requests for assistance, enables administrators to manage and track these requests, and provides a structured workflow for relief organizations.

The project is built using Python (Flask) as the backend framework, SQLite for database storage, and HTML/CSS for the user interface, ensuring a lightweight, scalable, and easy-to-use platform. ReliefTracker aims to improve response times, enhance transparency, and streamline disaster relief efforts through an efficient and user-friendly system.

* User Request Page: Allows users to submit and track their requests.
* Admin Dashboard: Enables administrators to manage and assign requests.
* Volunteer Page: Displays assigned tasks and relief efforts.

### Backend Operations (Flask Framework):
* Handles user authentication and session management.
* Processes request submissions, approvals, and updates.
* Manages database interactions for efficient data retrieval and modification.
* Sends email or SMS notifications for status updates.
